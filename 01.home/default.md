**M2IF - Magento 2 Import Framework** - provides several components to build import solutions for Magento 2.

The purpose of **M2IF** is to provide a fully functional replacement for the ***Magento 2 Standard Import functionality*** with a 100 % CSV file compatibility. 

* In contrast to other approaches, the **M2IF - Magento 2 Import Framework** is not created as a ***Magento 2*** extension and has no dependencies to other frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, or others. 
* In return, the **M2IF - Magento 2 Import Framework** provides independent components, that can easily be tied together as needed, just by adding them as composer dependency.
* The simple command line implementation Tool **M2IF - Simple Console Tool** should show you a brief overview, how a simple import application could work.
* For more information, check the [M2IF - Simple Console Tool](https://github.com/techdivision/import-cli-simple) repository.
